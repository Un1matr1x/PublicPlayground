# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| x.x.x   | :x:                |

Since this is only a playground, there is no stable version and no support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
